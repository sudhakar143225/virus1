  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), is a DNA virus in the herpesvirus family. It is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels, and is also linked to certain lymphomas.</p>
  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> KSHV is primarily transmitted through saliva, but can also be spread through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantation. The risk of transmission is higher in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS.</p>
  <p><strong>Oncogenic Potential:</strong> KSHV infects endothelial cells and B lymphocytes. It encodes several proteins that interfere with normal cell cycle regulation, inhibit apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), all of which contribute to tumor development. KSHV is associated with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</li>
    <li>Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)</li>
    <li>Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> KSHV is more common in certain regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, and parts of the Middle East. In these areas, infection often occurs in childhood, while in other regions it is more common among men who have sex with men and immunocompromised individuals.</p>
  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> There is no vaccine for KSHV. Preventive measures include practicing safe sex, avoiding sharing personal items that may be contaminated with saliva, and screening blood and organ donors.</p>

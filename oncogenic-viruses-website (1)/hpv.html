  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 200 related viruses, some of which are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide.</p>
  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> HPV is primarily spread through intimate skin-to-skin contact, most often during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It can also be transmitted through non-sexual routes, such as from mother to child during birth.</p>
  <p><strong>Oncogenic Potential:</strong> Certain high-risk types of HPV (especially types 16 and 18) can cause cellular changes that may lead to cancer. HPV is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer and is also linked to cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva, and oropharynx (throat).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cervical cancer:</strong> Over 99% of cases are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV types.</li>
    <li><strong>Other cancers:</strong> HPV is a major cause of anal, oropharyngeal, penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers.</li>
    <li><strong>Benign conditions:</strong> Low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts and respiratory papillomatosis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> Most sexually active people will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives, but most infections are asymptomatic and clear spontaneously. Persistent infection with high-risk types increases cancer risk.</p>
  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Vaccines are available and highly effective at preventing infection with the most dangerous HPV types. Regular screening (such as Pap smears) and practicing safe sex are also important preventive measures.</p>

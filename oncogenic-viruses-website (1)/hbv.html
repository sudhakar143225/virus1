  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that infects the liver and can cause both acute and chronic liver disease. Chronic infection with HBV is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).</p>
  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> HBV is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. Common routes include unprotected sex, sharing needles, from mother to child during childbirth, and through contaminated medical equipment.</p>
  <p><strong>Oncogenic Potential:</strong> Chronic HBV infection leads to ongoing liver inflammation and cell turnover, increasing the risk of genetic mutations and cancer. The virus can integrate its DNA into the host genome, disrupting normal cell regulation and promoting tumor development.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hepatocellular carcinoma:</strong> HBV is responsible for up to 50% of liver cancer cases worldwide.</li>
    <li><strong>Cirrhosis:</strong> Chronic infection can also cause liver cirrhosis, further increasing cancer risk.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> Over 250 million people globally are chronically infected with HBV. The risk of chronic infection is highest when the virus is acquired at birth or in early childhood.</p>
  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> A safe and effective vaccine is available and is the best way to prevent HBV infection and its complications. Other preventive measures include practicing safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, and ensuring safe blood transfusions.</p>

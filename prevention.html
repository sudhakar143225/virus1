  <h2>Prevention of Oncogenic Viruses</h2>
  <p>Preventing infections with oncogenic viruses is crucial for reducing the risk of virus-associated cancers. Here are the main strategies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vaccination:</strong> Vaccines are available for some oncogenic viruses, such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). These vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection and the cancers associated with these viruses.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe Sex Practices:</strong> Using condoms and limiting the number of sexual partners can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted oncogenic viruses like HPV and HIV.</li>
    <li><strong>Screening Blood and Organ Donations:</strong> Rigorous screening of blood and organ donors helps prevent transmission of viruses such as HBV, HCV, and HTLV-1.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoiding Needle Sharing:</strong> Not sharing needles or syringes is essential to prevent the spread of blood-borne viruses like HBV, HCV, and HTLV-1.</li>
    <li><strong>Mother-to-Child Transmission Prevention:</strong> For some viruses, such as HBV and HIV, antiviral treatment during pregnancy and avoiding breastfeeding (in the case of HTLV-1) can reduce the risk of transmission to the baby.</li>
    <li><strong>Good Hygiene and Health Practices:</strong> General hygiene, such as not sharing personal items (toothbrushes, razors), and following infection control protocols in healthcare settings, can help prevent transmission.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Screening and Early Detection:</strong> Regular medical check-ups and cancer screening (e.g., Pap smears for cervical cancer) can help detect precancerous changes early, especially in high-risk individuals.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Public health education and awareness campaigns are also important in promoting preventive behaviors and increasing vaccine uptake.</p>

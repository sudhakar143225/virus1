  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a member of the herpesvirus family and is one of the most common human viruses. It is best known for causing infectious mononucleosis ("mono" or the "kissing disease") but is also associated with several types of cancer.</p>
  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> EBV is primarily spread through bodily fluids, especially saliva. It can also be transmitted through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantation.</p>
  <p><strong>Oncogenic Potential:</strong> EBV infects B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. It can drive the transformation of infected cells by expressing viral proteins that disrupt normal cell cycle regulation, inhibit apoptosis, and promote cell proliferation. EBV is associated with several malignancies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Burkitt lymphoma</li>
    <li>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma</li>
    <li>Hodgkin lymphoma</li>
    <li>Gastric carcinoma</li>
    <li>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> More than 90% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV by age 35-40. Most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild illness, but the virus remains latent in the body for life.</p>
  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> There is no vaccine for EBV. Preventive measures include avoiding the sharing of drinks, food, or personal items with infected individuals and practicing safe sex.</p>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that infects T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is the first human retrovirus discovered and is associated with several diseases, most notably adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).</p>
  <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> HTLV-1 is transmitted through blood transfusions, sharing of needles, sexual contact, and from mother to child via breastfeeding. The risk of transmission increases with prolonged exposure.</p>
  <p><strong>Oncogenic Potential:</strong> HTLV-1 can cause infected T-cells to proliferate uncontrollably by integrating its genetic material into the host genome and expressing viral proteins (such as Tax and HBZ) that disrupt normal cell cycle regulation and promote cell survival. This can eventually lead to the development of ATLL, a rare and aggressive cancer of T-cells.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL):</strong> A malignancy of T lymphocytes, often resistant to treatment and associated with poor prognosis.</li>
    <li><strong>HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP):</strong> A chronic neurological disorder caused by HTLV-1 infection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prevalence:</strong> HTLV-1 is endemic in certain regions, including southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, and South America. Millions of people are infected worldwide, but only a small percentage develop related diseases.</p>
  <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Preventive measures include screening blood products, avoiding sharing needles, practicing safe sex, and advising HTLV-1 positive mothers to avoid breastfeeding if possible.</p>
